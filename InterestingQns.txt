Interesting Qns to revisit
Problem 67 - Fibonacci Seq
	> can use hashing to avoid long generation of numbers 
	> use modular arithmetic approach

	> using rotation in place - rotate twice in between two centre
Problem 81 - Bit counting
	> BIT WISE OPERATOR
Problem 61 - Prime Number Generator
	> Optimise on Sieve methods (~21.9s)

Problem 59 - Bulls n Cows
	> Use the "hints" to solve the code
Problem 22 - Two Printers
	> Optimise methods of finding the min time
Problem 34 - Binary searching
	> solving monotonic eq for x
Problem 33 - Parity Control
	> Use BinToDec and DecToBin own method 
Problem 53 - King N Queen
	> do function check for each of the chess piece
